Return ONLY valid JSON - NO explanations, comments, or text outside JSON\n2. Do NOT include markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)\n3. Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON object\n4. Use double quotes for all JSON strings\n5. Ensure all JSON properties are properly closed with commas\n6. The executionCode must be a properly escaped JSON string\n7. ALWAYS include meaningful config fields for workflow-level settings\n8. If using config parameters in executionCode, MUST define them in config.fields\n9. MANDATORY: Every node MUST have at least 2-4 config fields - NEVER EVER leave config.fields as empty array []\n10. Config fields are displayed in the workflow editor UI for user configuration\n11. CONFIG FIELDS ARE REQUIRED - If you don't include config fields, the response will be rejected\n12. Think of what users would want to configure: timeouts, URLs, credentials, paths, formats, retry counts, etc.\n13. EVERY generated node MUST have config.fields with real, useful configuration options\n14. CRITICAL: Use CONTEXTUAL INTELLIGENCE to determine the PRIMARY field users need\n15. CRITICAL: If the node connects to external services → connection field MUST be first (url/endpoint/host)\n16. CRITICAL: If the node executes commands/scripts → execution field MUST be first (command/script/query)\n17. CRITICAL: If the node processes files → path field MUST be first (filePath/directory/source)\n18. CRITICAL: If the node sends notifications → destination field MUST be first (recipient/channel/target)\n19. CRITICAL: Always include authentication for external services (apiKey/token/credentials)\n20. CRITICAL: Always provide the ESSENTIAL configuration users need for the operation to work
21. CRITICAL: NEVER use setTimeout, setInterval, process.exit, or any forbidden sandbox APIs
22. CRITICAL: Return results immediately - NO async delays or timers in execution code\n\nJSON STRUCTURE REQUIRED:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Node Name\",\n  \"description\": \"What this node does\",\n

and automatically determine what config fields are needed based on operation type:\n\nCONNECTION-BASED OPERATIONS (APIs, databases, services, webhooks, integrations):\n- ALWAYS include connection details as FIRST field (url/endpoint/host/connectionString/server)\n- ALWAYS include authentication (apiKey/token/username/password/credentials/accessKey)\n- Include timeout and retry logic for reliability\n\nCOMMAND/EXECUTION OPERATIONS (CLI tools, scripts, shells, any executable):\n- ALWAYS include primary execution field as FIRST field (command/script/query/statement)\n- Include execution context (workingDirectory/environment/shell/interpreter)\n- Include timeout and resource limits\n\nFILE/DATA OPERATIONS (file processing, storage, backup, sync, transfer):\n- ALWAYS include path/location fields (inputPath/outputPath/directory/bucket/source/destination)\n- Include format and processing options (format/encoding/compression/schema)\n- Include credentials for remote storage access\n\nNOTIFICATION/COMMUNICATION (email, chat, SMS, alerts, webhooks):\n- ALWAYS include destination (recipient/channel/number/webhook/target)\n- Include message content configuration (subject/body/template/format)\n- Include service configuration (server/credentials/port)\n\nPROCESSING/TRANSFORMATION (data processing, conversion, analysis):\n- Include input/output specifications (inputFormat/outputFormat/schema/structure)\n- Include processing parameters (batchSize/parallelism/memory/limit)\n- Include validation and error handling options\n\nINTELLIGENT CONFIG FIELD REQUIREMENTS:\n- MINIMUM 2 fields, MAXIMUM 5 fields per node\n- ANALYZE the node purpose and automatically include the PRIMARY field users need to configure\n- Use contextual intelligence: if it connects to something → connection details, if it executes something → command/script field\n- ALWAYS include a timeout field for any operation that could hang or take time\n- ALWAYS include authentication fields for external service integrations\n- Use appropriate field types based on content: text, number, select, toggle, textarea, password\n- Use textarea for multi-line content (commands, scripts, code, messages)\n- Use text for single values (URLs, paths, names, IDs)\n- Use password type for sensitive data (tokens, keys, passwords)\n- Use select for predefined options (environments, methods, formats)\n- Provide meaningful default values that work out of the box when possible\n- Include helpful descriptions explaining what each field does\n- Think about what a user would ACTUALLY need to configure for this specific operation\n\nVALIDATION RULES:\n- All strings must use double quotes\n- No trailing commas\n- executionCode must be properly escaped\n- No JavaScript comments in JSON\n- Start response immediately with {\n- config.fields array MUST NOT be empty\n\nEXECUTION CODE SANDBOX CONSTRAINTS:\n- Code runs in a Docker sandbox with limited access\n- ONLY console.log() and console.error() are available (NO console.info, console.warn, console.debug)\n- ABSOLUTELY NO ACCESS TO: process, global, Buffer, require, setTimeout, setInterval, fs, net, http\n- NO timers: setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate are FORBIDDEN and will cause errors\n- NO process control: process.exit, process.env are FORBIDDEN\n- NO file system: fs operations are FORBIDDEN\n- NO network: http, https, fetch, XMLHttpRequest are FORBIDDEN\n- NO external dependencies or imports\n- Must be pure JavaScript - no TypeScript, no JSX\n- Always use try/catch for error handling\n- Return plain objects only (will be JSON serialized)\n- Execution timeout enforced by sandbox\n- DO NOT USE any async delays - return results immediately\n- For timing/delays, document in config but DO NOT implement with setTimeout\n\nCORRECT EXECUTION CODE EXAMPLE:\nconst executeNode = async (inputs, context, config) => {\n  try {\n    console.log('Starting execution'); // ONLY console.log or console.error\n    \n    // Your logic here\n    const result = inputs.data || 'Hello World';\n    \n    console.log('Execution complete');\n    return {\n      success: true,\n      result: result\n    };\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error:', error.message);\n    throw new Error(`Execution failed: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n};",
