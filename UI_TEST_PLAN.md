# ðŸ§ª Comprehensive UI Test Plan - Workflow Editor

## ðŸ“‹ Test Requirements

### Core Features to Implement & Test:

1. **Node Types** - Different workflow node categories
2. **Node Editing** - Configure node properties and settings  
3. **Save/Load** - Persist workflows to database
4. **Execute** - Run workflows and show results
5. **Node Palette** - Drag-and-drop component library
6. **End-to-End** - Complete workflow creation flow

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Plan Execution

### Phase 1: Node Types Implementation
- [ ] Input nodes (manual input, file upload, webhook)
- [ ] Script nodes (JavaScript, Python, Bash)
- [ ] Logic nodes (conditional, loop, merge)
- [ ] Output nodes (file export, API call, email)
- [ ] Visual distinction between node types

### Phase 2: Node Editing Interface
- [ ] Click to edit node properties
- [ ] Modal/panel for node configuration
- [ ] Form validation and saving
- [ ] Script editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Real-time preview of changes

### Phase 3: Save/Load Functionality
- [ ] Connect to backend API endpoints
- [ ] Auto-save workflow changes
- [ ] Load existing workflows from database
- [ ] Handle workflow versioning
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### Phase 4: Workflow Execution
- [ ] Execute button triggers backend API
- [ ] Real-time execution status updates
- [ ] Log viewer with execution details
- [ ] Error handling and display
- [ ] Results visualization

### Phase 5: Node Palette
- [ ] Draggable node library sidebar
- [ ] Category-based organization
- [ ] Search and filter nodes
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to canvas
- [ ] Node templates and examples

### Phase 6: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Complete workflow creation flow
- [ ] Authentication integration
- [ ] Dashboard integration
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

## ðŸš€ Implementation Order

1. **Node Types** - Foundation for all other features
2. **Node Editing** - Core interaction model
3. **Save/Load** - Data persistence
4. **Node Palette** - User experience enhancement
5. **Execute** - Workflow functionality
6. **End-to-End** - Integration testing

## âœ… Success Criteria

- User can create workflows with different node types
- User can configure each node with custom properties
- Workflows persist to database and reload correctly
- Workflows execute and show real-time feedback
- Interface is intuitive and responsive
- No critical bugs or errors in normal usage
